#Andromeda
This game was created for SI 206 Project 4 and is based on Atari's Asteroids. It was created over 20 days and took somewhere between 20-30 hours of reading, designing, and making. The images for the spaceship and asteroids were made by me in Adobe Illustrator. The background image, text font, and sound effects were borrowed from some awesome free sources listed below. 

The game begins on the start screen which displays the game title and logo. The user presses the 'enter' to begin the game. The objective of the game is to avoid asteroids and shoot enough down to score 60 points. Once you do, you win. If you lose too much health before then, you lose. If you kill all the asteroids (or get hit by some of them) without dying or reaching 60 points, you also lose. Wining or losing triggers different sprites to be killed or displayed. Originally I had it so that the user could press 'enter' again (once the game over message has been displayed) and the game would loop back to the beginning. I decided to leave this out because I noticed it was affecting the sound effects. The (more or less) working code for a game restart is commented out in the main loop. In order to quit the game the user closes the screen.

I'd like to continue work on this game and make it more sophisticated. It would be great to add gravity and 360 degree movement to the spaceship. I'd also like to fix a couple of small bugs, add multiple levels, and generally make the game more complex. I consider this project a work in progress.
